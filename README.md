# ⚽ Soccer Talent AI – National Talent Identification and Youth Development System 
A large-scale AI-powered system to **identify**, **analyze**, and **track young soccer talents** in schools and public spaces. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and coach feedback, this platform builds a national talent database with real-time performance analysis and development tracking.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Automate **video analysis** of soccer matches from schools and public fields.
- Extract detailed **player performance metrics** using computer vision and AI models.
- Build and maintain a **national talent database** with progress tracking.
- Provide **feedback and suggestions** to coaches.
- Help identify **gaps or uncertainties** in assessments and propose player experiments (e.g., trying new positions).
